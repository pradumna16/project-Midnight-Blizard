How to operationalize:

Implement as an Exchange transport rule or DLP rule: quarantine .rdp attachments from external senders and send to analyst review.

If your mail gateway can sandbox attachments, submit to sandbox for quick verdict.

Add an automated workflow: quarantine → extract attachment hash → check TI feeds → release if safe.
